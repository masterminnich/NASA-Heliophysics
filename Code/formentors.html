		<p class="title">Instructions to post research opportunities</p>
		<p class="body">To post research opportunities, please visit the NASA's intern website: https://intern.nasa.gov/. Notice that previous intern website, OSSI (One Stop Shopping Initiative) application is retired as of May 31, 2018 and is no longer accessible to students or NASA users.</p>
		<p class="title">Important</p>
		<p class="body">Write "SESI" as the first word of your title, so it goes to the right program. Example: "SESI-'Your research opportunity title here'". All interns (including foreign nationals and lawful permanent residents use search features to find SESI opportunities).<br><br>
Do not send your funds to Office of Education, they will have to be sent to CUA.<br><br>
Write your name in your posted research opportunity, so we can identify you as a mentor.<br><br>
Please, let somebody from the SESI team know that you submitted a research opportunity.<br><br>
Send the information of the student/s you will be having (name, institution, title of the project, undergraduate or graduate status, etc.) to the SESI team as soon as the student accepts the internship.</p>
