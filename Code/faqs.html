		<p class="faqq" id="1q" tabindex="0">What is SESI?<br><br></p>
		<p class="faqa" id="1a">The SESI program is a cooperative program between the Physics Department at the Catholic University of America (CUA) and the Heliophysics Science Division (HSD) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.<br><br>
		SESI provides qualified students with exciting research opportunities and the chance to work with mentors (the scientists, engineers, and researchers of GSFC) in the areas of solar and heliospheric physics, data analysis and computational modeling, building space hardware, and many other scientific fields.<br><br>
		In addition to research, students attend weekly lectures from senior scientists, tour Goddard's facilities, and can participate in optional weekend activities in the Washington, D.C. area such as park/trail hiking and museum tours. 
		<br><br><br></p>
		
		<p class="faqq" id="2q" tabindex="0">Who should apply?<br><br></p>
		<p class="faqa" id="2a">We accept talented and highly motivated students; SESI strives to offer opportunities to a diverse population of students who are dedicated to their research and interested in a fun and engaging summer program.<br><br><br></p>
		
		<p class="faqq" id="3q" tabindex="0">How do I apply? <br><br></p>
		<p class="faqa" id="3a">Visit NASA's internship website at https://intern.nasa.gov/. Please, notice that previous intern website, OSSI (One Stop Shopping Initiative) application is retired as of May 31, 2018 and is no longer accessible to students or NASA users.<br><br>
		To see research opportunities, first you need to create an account and fill the application forms. Then, you can search internship opportunities.<br><br><br></p>
		
		<p class="faqq" id="4q" tabindex="0">I am a foreign national/lawful permanent resident and I would like to apply to a SESI research opportunity, can I?<br><br></p>
		<p class="faqa" id="4a">You can! Please, check the "International Intern" link at https://intern.nasa.gov/.<br><br>
		Funding and application options may also be available to lawful permanent residents and foreign nationals who are interested in SESI, usually at the request of GSFC mentors.<br>
		Send Teresa (see "Contact" link) the following documents to apply: A rÃ©sumÃ© with full name, phone number, email, and any additional information about yourself that might be useful to a mentor in their evaluation, including detailed work and academic history. Please also provide citizenship status, references, and a cover letter that should describe any special interests and the types of opportunities for which you would like to be considered (see question below on how to find SESI research opportunities). We'll then send your application materials to the mentors of those opportunities for their consideration alongside the OSSI applicants.<br>
		Contact Dr. Teresa Nieves-Chinchilla, CEPHEUS Director of Education, at Teresa.Nieves@nasa.gov for additional information. 
		<br></p>
		
		<p class="faqq" id="5q" tabindex="0">How do I find SESI research opportunities?<br></p>
		<p class="faqa" id="5a">Search the research opportunities in the NASA's intern webpage for the word "SESI" to see if there are any positions you'd like to apply for with us at GSFC.<br>
		Check the website back a few times leading up to the application deadline as opportunities are posted continuously.<br></p>

		<p class="faqq" id="6q" tabindex="0">Can I apply to more than one opportunity?<br></p>
		<p class="faqa" id="6a">Absolutely! <br></p>

		<p class="faqa" id="8a">It is. If accepted, you would be working 40 hours per week. Our interns submit hours and are paid semi-monthly, either via digital or physical paychecks from The Catholic University of America.<br></p>
		
		<p class="faqq" id="9q" tabindex="0">What NASA missions could I work on?<br></p>
		<p class="faqa" id="9a">Some current projects/missions include: Advanced Composition Explorer, Community Coordinated Modeling Center, Deep Space Climate Observatory, Magnetospheric Multiscale, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, sounding rockets, smallsats, and many more!</p>
