		A multi-decade program dedicated to training the next generation of scientists and engineers<br><br>
		The SESI program is a cooperative program between the Physics Department at the Catholic University of America (CUA) and the Heliophysics Science Division (HSD) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.<br><br>
		SESI provides qualified students with exciting research opportunities and the chance to work with mentors (the scientists, engineers, and researchers of GSFC) in the areas of solar and heliospheric physics, data analysis and computational modeling, building space hardware, and many other scientific fields.<br><br>
		In addition to research, students attend weekly lectures from senior scientists, tour Goddard's facilities, and can participate in optional weekend activities in the Washington, D.C. area such as park/trail hiking and museum tours.
